This directory contains scripts for simulating charge motion in Ge strip detectors. 
There are 2 types of scripts: charge sharing (across strips), and charge transport, which should give readout timing information.
The original code is in IDL (.pro files) and was written by Steven Boggs.
Python scripts were adapted from the IDL code by Sean Pike, with help from ChatGPT.
